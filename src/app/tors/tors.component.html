<strong>
  16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION (The "Arbitration Clause"). </strong>In the event of a dispute, you and Shopnroar agree to submit to binding arbitration, except that if you have violated or threatened to violate Shopnroar's or any Shopnroar Partner or User's intellectual property rights, Shopnroar or the Shopnroar Partner or User may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in the state or federal courts in the state of California, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. The arbitration will be held before one arbitrator on an individual basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive any right you may have to arbitrate a Dispute as a class action.
  </div>
  <span id='infoCo'></span><br>

  <div class='innerText'>

    <strong>    17. You and Shopnroar shall agree on one arbitrator to conduct the arbitration.</strong> The arbitrator shall apply governing substantive law in making an award. In any arbitration, Shopnroar will pay the filing, administration, service or case management fee, plus the costs associated with the first day of arbitration, with the remaining costs to be paid by the non-prevailing party. Shopnroar will pay additional arbitration expenses to the extent that the arbitrator determines that Shopnroar must in order to ensure the enforceability of this arbitration clause. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law.
    The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The United States Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. If any part of this Arbitration Clause, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder remains enforceable.
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, this agreement provides that all disputes between you and shopnroar will be resolved by binding arbitration and not in court or by jury trial. If a dispute is arbitrated, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against shopnroar including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.
